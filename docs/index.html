We are committed to a clear billing, security, privacy, and accessibility standard in Pairment. 
</p>

<h2><a href="/docs/billing">Billing</a></h2>
<p>How our pricing plans and billing works.</p>

<h2><a href="/docs/privacy">Information privacy</a></h2>
<p>We value your privacy and are very clear when you are going to configure an accessibility check that sends data back to us.</p>

<h2><a href="/docs/cms">CMS Integrations</a></h2>
<p>While you can easily add Pairment to any site, our existing CMS integrations might make it even faster to add accessibility testing to your site.</p>

<h2><a href="/docs/checks">Accessibility checks</a></h2>
<p>What we test, and how it aligns with WCAG standards.</p>
