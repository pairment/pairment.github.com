title: Write text clearly
---

<div>
<p>People read differently on screens than they do on paper. This means you will need to write differently, too.</p>

<p>By the time a child is 5 or 6 years old, they&#x2019;ll use 2,500 to 5,000 common words. Adults still find these words easier to recognize and understand than words they&#x2019;ve learned since.</p>

<p>Don&#x2019;t use formal or long words when easy or short ones will do. Use &#x2018;buy&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;purchase&#x2019;, &#x2018;help&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;assist&#x2019;, &#x2018;about&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;approximately&#x2019; and &#x2018;like&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;such as&#x2019;.</p>
