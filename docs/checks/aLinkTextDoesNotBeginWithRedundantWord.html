title: Link text should not begin with redundant text
---

<div>Since screen reader users already hear links labeled as &quot;link,&quot; starting a link text with a similar word causes redundancy. Try to change links to more natural language by removing repetitive words. We currently consider the following words repetitive:</div>

<ul>
	<li>link</li>
	<li>go to</li>
	<li>click here</li>
	<li>more</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guideline information:</h2>
This check applies to WCAG 2.0 Sections:

<ul>
	<li>2.4.9</li>
</ul>
and WCAG techniques:

<ul>
	<li>F84</li>
</ul>
